# Test Strategy Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the E-Commerce Demo application, covering all aspects of quality assurance including functional, non-functional, and automation testing approaches.

## 2. Scope

### In Scope
- Web application functionality (UI/UX)
- REST API endpoints
- Cross-browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness
- Performance testing
- Security testing (basic)
- Accessibility compliance

### Out of Scope
- Load testing beyond basic performance
- Penetration testing
- Third-party integrations (payment gateways)
- Database performance tuning

## 3. Test Levels

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- **Responsibility**: Development team
- **Coverage**: Individual functions and components
- **Tools**: Jest, React Testing Library

### 3.2 Integration Testing
- **Responsibility**: QA team
- **Coverage**: API endpoints, database interactions
- **Tools**: Jest, Supertest

### 3.3 System Testing
- **Responsibility**: QA team
- **Coverage**: End-to-end user workflows
- **Tools**: Playwright, manual testing

### 3.4 Acceptance Testing
- **Responsibility**: Business stakeholders + QA
- **Coverage**: Business requirements validation
- **Tools**: Manual testing, UAT scripts

## 4. Test Types

### 4.1 Functional Testing
- **Authentication**: Login, registration, password recovery
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations, search, filtering
- **Shopping Cart**: Add/remove items, quantity updates
- **Checkout Process**: Payment flow, order confirmation
- **User Management**: Profile updates, order history

### 4.2 Non-Functional Testing
- **Performance**: Response times, page load speeds
- **Usability**: User experience, navigation flow
- **Compatibility**: Cross-browser, mobile devices
- **Security**: Input validation, authentication
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance

## 5. Test Environment Strategy

### 5.1 Environment Types
- **Development**: http://localhost:3000
- **Staging**: https://staging.ecommerce-demo.com
- **Production**: https://ecommerce-demo.com

### 5.2 Test Data Management
- **Static Data**: Predefined users, products, categories
- **Dynamic Data**: Generated using Faker.js
- **Data Cleanup**: Automated cleanup after test execution

## 6. Automation Strategy

### 6.1 Automation Pyramid
- **70% Unit Tests**: Fast, isolated, developer-owned
- **20% Integration Tests**: API and service layer
- **10% UI Tests**: Critical user journeys only

### 6.2 Tool Selection
- **UI Automation**: Playwright (cross-browser, reliable)
- **API Testing**: Jest + Supertest (Node.js ecosystem)
- **Reporting**: Allure (comprehensive, visual)

## 7. Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- Payment processing workflow
- User authentication and authorization
- Data integrity during concurrent operations
- Cross-browser compatibility issues

### Mitigation Strategies
- Comprehensive test coverage for critical paths
- Automated regression testing
- Regular security audits
- Performance monitoring

## 8. Entry and Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria
